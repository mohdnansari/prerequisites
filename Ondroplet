Step1: create a DO droplet instance with preinstalled docker image on ubuntu 18+.
Step2: create a non-root super user

Step3: install golang
      https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-on-ubuntu-18-04
Step4: Correctly set GOPATH and GOROOT. essential for go runtime.
Step5: install nodeJS through PPA
      https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04
      **Note: run "npm -v" at least once after installation. this creates a much needed config file that npm will search for in 
              future runs.

Step6: now download the fabric binary images along with fabric-samples

Step7: **** verify installation of fabric ***
      A) run ./byfn.sh up -t 100  !!! See point D befor running this !!!
            Note: Ubuntu 18+ takes up RAM. The VM instance should have 2GB of RAM. Shorter RAM can result in runtime memory 
                  exhaustion issues. 
      B) if something goes wrong due to connectivity issues/etc, before runnign byfn up again, first bring down with "byfn down"
         Also, make sure there are not running containers (docker ps -aq). If needed kill the ones in memory.
      C) ./byfn down and then docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
      D) IMPORTANT: while running ./byfn.sh up, sometimes the script runs slow, due to various factors like CPU, Ram availability etc
                    use the timeout flag i.e. -t 100, so that the process waits 100 seconds before timing out.
